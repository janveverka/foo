Test the behaviour of logging in imported modules

Questions and Answers:
Q1. What configuration is in effect when logging.basicConfig is called
    multiple times, e.g. in imported modules?
A1. The one that is used in the first call to logging.basicConfig.
    "As itâ€™s intended as a one-off simple configuration facility, only the 
    first call will actually do anything: subsequent calls are effectively 
    no-ops."
